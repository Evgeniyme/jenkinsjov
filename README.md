# Jenkins Pipeline Configuration Documentation

This documentation explains how to configure a Jenkins pipeline for a multi-OS, multi-architecture build process using a Jenkinsfile and a Makefile.

## Jenkinsfile

The Jenkinsfile is written in Groovy DSL and defines the build pipeline stages and steps. 

### Parameters

The Jenkinsfile specifies two parameters:

-   `OS`: The operating system for which to build. Choices are 'linux', 'darwin', 'windows'.
-   `ARCH`: The architecture for which to build. Choices are 'x86_64', 'arm64'.

### Stages

The Jenkinsfile defines a single stage, 'Build', which executes the appropriate make command based on the values of the 'OS' and 'ARCH' parameters.

## Makefile

The Makefile contains the actual build commands for each combination of operating system and architecture. Below is a generalized structure of the Makefile:

        .PHONY: linux macOS windows arm
    
    linux:
    	# Build command for Linux x86_64
    
    macOS:
    	# Build command for macOS x86_64
    
    windows:
    	# Build command for Windows x86_64
    
    arm:
    	# Build command for Linux arm64

### Targets

The Makefile specifies four targets that correspond to the options provided by the 'OS' and 'ARCH' parameters in the Jenkinsfile:

-   `linux`: Builds for Linux x86_64.
-   `macOS`: Builds for macOS x86_64.
-   `windows`: Builds for Windows x86_64.
-   `arm`: Builds for Linux arm64.

## Using the Pipeline

To use the pipeline, start a build in Jenkins. You will be prompted to choose values for the 'OS' and 'ARCH' parameters. Choose the desired operating system and architecture, then start the build. Jenkins will execute the appropriate build command based on your choices.

Please note that all the necessary dependencies for building your project must be installed on the Jenkins agent where this script runs.
